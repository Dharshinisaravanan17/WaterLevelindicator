Simple Water Level indicator using TinkerCad stimulation tool
Water Level Controller System

Overview

This project presents the design and implementation of a Water Level Controller system utilizing an Arduino microcontroller. The system aims to automate the process of maintaining optimal water levels in a reservoir or tank by regulating the inflow and outflow of water using ultrasonic sensors.

The Water Level Controller system automates the maintenance of water levels in tanks using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. This cost-effective solution can be applied in agriculture, industry, and domestic settings to prevent water wastage and ensure consistent water supply.
